# `{nimo}` in brief
The `{nimo}` R package, based on [`{flexsdm}`](https://github.com/sjevelazco/flexsdm/) functionalities and powered by [`{shiny}`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny), offers users the flexibility to manipulate and parameterize models according to their unique research needs. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface that enables users to define complete or partial modeling procedures, including variables, records, algorithms, ensemble methods, and algorithm tuning. `{nimo}` seamlessly integrates with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [(GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search) occurence data, allowing users to easily query occurrence data for biodiversity research and incorporate it into their modeling analyses. This comprehensive package empowers researchers to explore, customize, and model their data effectively, with the added benefit of accessing real-world biodiversity data. They can intuitively control the input parameters, explore different modeling options, and observe the corresponding outputs in real-time. This visual and interactive experience enhances the usability and accessibility of the , allowing researchers to focus on their modeling tasks without worrying about complex programming or technical details.
