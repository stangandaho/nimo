Description: The nimo (niche modeler) R package, based on flexsdm and powered by 
    Shiny, offers users the flexibility to manipulate and parameterize models 
    according to their unique research needs. It provides a user-friendly graphical 
    interface that enables users to define complete or partial modeling procedures, 
    including variables, records, algorithms, ensemble methods, and algorithm tuning. 
    Additionally, nimo seamlessly integrates with the Global Biodiversity Information 
    Facility (GBIF), allowing users to easily query occurrence data for biodiversity 
    research and incorporate it into their modeling analyses. This comprehensive 
    package empowers researchers to explore, customize, and model their data 
    effectively, with the added benefit of accessing real-world biodiversity 
    data through GBIF.
