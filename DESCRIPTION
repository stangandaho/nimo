Description: An Application for flexibility to manipulate and parameterize
    models according to unique research needs. It provides a user-friendly
    graphical interface that enables users to define complete modeling
    procedures, including variables, records, algorithms, ensemble
    methods, and algorithm tuning.  Additionally, 'nimo' seamlessly
    integrates with the "Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)",
    allowing users to easily query occurrence data for biodiversity
    research and incorporate it into their modeling analyses.
